# #Program to Display the multiplication Table

# In[22]:


# Multiplication table (from 1 to 10) in Python

# To take input from the user
num = int(input("Display multiplication table of? "))

# Iterate 10 times from i = 1 to 10
for i in range(1, 11):
   print(num, 'x', i, '=', num*i)


# Here, we have used the for loop along with the range() function to iterate 10 times. The arguments inside the range() function are (1, 11). Meaning, greater than or equal to 1 and less than 11.
# 
# We have displayed the multiplication table of variable num (which is 12 in our case). You can change the value of num in the above program to test for other values.
